# titus2-feedstock
A conda recipe for titus2.
Titus 2 is a fork of the original Titus python library which resides in the (now defunct) Hadrian repository. Titus is not actively maintained by the Open Data Group and only supports Python 2, so this fork was created to actively support its development for Python 3.
